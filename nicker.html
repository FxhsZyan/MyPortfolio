        <h2>1. Situation Where Data is Collected and Transformed into Knowledge</h2>
        <p>In today’s world, data is gathered constantly across various fields. One example of data transformation is in the healthcare industry, where patient data is collected and turned into actionable knowledge to improve treatment outcomes. Initially, data is gathered through various means, such as patient surveys, medical tests, or monitoring devices.</p>
        <p>In the first stage, raw data is collected. This includes details like a patient's age, blood pressure, test results, and even medical history. At this point, the data is not yet useful on its own. It needs to be processed and organized to extract meaningful insights. This leads to the next stage—processing.</p>
        <p>The second stage is processing. This involves using various tools to sort, analyze, and interpret the raw data. For example, medical professionals may use algorithms to identify patterns in patient health records. The data may be categorized according to different parameters, such as age groups or specific medical conditions. Once the data is organized, it becomes information.</p>
        <p>Finally, the last stage of transformation occurs when information is interpreted and used to gain knowledge. For instance, after analyzing the data, doctors can recognize trends and predict potential health risks or recommend treatments based on the insights they gather. This knowledge allows healthcare professionals to make informed decisions that improve patient care and health outcomes.</p>

    <h2>5. Converting Decimal Numbers to Binary and Hexadecimal</h2>
    <p>Converting decimal numbers into binary and hexadecimal systems is a fundamental skill in computing, as these number systems are widely used in programming, digital electronics, and data representation. Let’s take the decimal number 25 and convert it into both binary and hexadecimal to illustrate the process.</p>
    
    <h3>Converting Decimal to Binary</h3>
    <p>To convert a decimal number into binary, we divide the number by 2 repeatedly and note down the remainder at each step. This process continues until the quotient becomes 0. Let’s convert the decimal number 25 into binary:</p>
    <pre>
        25 ÷ 2 = 12, remainder 1
        12 ÷ 2 = 6, remainder 0
        6 ÷ 2 = 3, remainder 0
        3 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 1
        1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1
    </pre>
    <p>Now, we take the remainders in reverse order: 1, 1, 0, 0, 1. Therefore, the binary representation of decimal 25 is <strong>11001</strong>.</p>
     <img src="dec.jpg" alt="flowchart" width="400" height="300">

    
    <h3>Converting Decimal to Hexadecimal</h3>
    <p>To convert a decimal number into hexadecimal, we divide the number by 16 and record the remainder. This process is similar to converting to binary, but since hexadecimal is base 16, the remainders will range from 0 to 15, where 10-15 are represented by the letters A-F. Let’s now convert decimal 25 into hexadecimal:</p>
    <pre>
        25 ÷ 16 = 1, remainder 9
        1 ÷ 16 = 0, remainder 1
    </pre>
    <p>Reading the remainders in reverse order, we get <strong>19</strong>. Therefore, the hexadecimal representation of decimal 25 is <strong>19</strong>.</p>
 <img src="hexa.jpg" alt="flowchart" width="400" height="300">
    
    <h3>Why These Conversions Matter</h3>
    <p>Understanding how to convert between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal is essential for anyone working with computers or digital systems. Binary is the language that computers understand at the hardware level, while hexadecimal offers a more compact representation of binary data, making it easier for humans to read and work with.
